* Model:
    * It directly manages the data, logic and rules of the application
        * Observer Patter
        * Facade
* View:
    * Any representation of information such as a chart, diagram or table.
* Controller:
    * Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.
        * Command Pattern
        * ActionListeners, which execute the commands.

* TextChanel
    * [JTextPane stackoverflow] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31928306/how-to-create-and-use-a-jtextpane)
    * [JTextPane JavaDocs] (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/JTextPane.html)
    * [JTextPane stackOverflow] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4059198/jtextpane-appending-a-new-string)
    * [DefaultStyledDocument for JTextPane] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50152438/jtextpane-wont-display-text-added-by-defaultstyleddocument)
* User class
    * [RandomColorGenerator] (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4246351/creating-random-colour-in-java)
    * Professor Salu reminded me of swingInvokers and why they are important
      * ``"Remember, invoke later is like politely asking the renderer to show 
         when you have the chance.  If you want to be more demanding, invoke 
         and wait. "``
* NetworkListener
    * After familiarizing myself with Sam's implementation of the class and
      how it interacts with other classes, I was able to come to the
      conclusion of calling the observers notifier there.
* NetworkRelay
    * I had begun looking at different resources to integrate the gui with the
      NetworkRelay but nothing was quite working. I had gotten the gui to
      update with the ObjectStreamReader but not the Users input. After Ryan
      shared his part on a separate branch (That worked) to get the users'
      message, I was able to add it to my files so that both of our
      implementations worked together.
